                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the field of computer science, it is very common to
                        have to find an optimal solution while considering two
                        or more factors. The Knapsack Problem is a
                        classic optimization problem that arises in various
                        fields such as computer science, operations research,
                        and finance. It involves selecting a subset of items
                        with specific weights and values to maximize the total
                        value while staying within a given weight capacity. In
                        this comprehensive guide, we'll explore different
                        approaches to solving the Knapsack Problem in Python.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                    <p>
                        Before diving into the solution, let's understand the
                        problem statement. Given a set of items, each with a
                        weight and a value, the task is to determine the maximum
                        value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of
                        items without exceeding a given weight capacity.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the most efficient ways to solve the Knapsack
                        Problem is by using dynamic programming. The dynamic
                        programming approach involves breaking down the problem
                        into subproblems and solving them in a bottom-up manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To break down this problem we are going to create a 2D
                        Table to store our intermediate results. Each row in the
                        table represents a specific item and each column
                        represent a partial capacity of the knapsack. For each
                        location on the table, a choice is made about whether
                        the item in that row can be included to create a better
                        solution. The value at table location (x, y) represents
                        the best sum of items 1 through x that is still less
                        than weight y.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's a step-by-step guide to this approach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Define the Problem:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Define the function to solve the Knapsack
                                    Problem, taking the items, weights, values,
                                    and capacity as inputs.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a 2D Table:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Initialize a 2D array to store the
                                    intermediate results. The rows represent the
                                    items and the columns represent a partially
                                    filled capacity of the knapsack.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Base Case:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Set the base case values. For the item at
                                    (0,0) there is no space in the back and no
                                    items can be used.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fill the Table:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Iterate through each item and remaining
                                    capacity, filling the table based on whether
                                    the item should be included or excluded.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Backtrack to Find Solution:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Once the item is filled, backtrack through
                                    it to find out which items were used to
                                    contribute to the maximum value.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Solving the Knapsack Problem efficiently is crucial in
                        various applications, and the dynamic programming
                        approach provides an elegant solution. By breaking down
                        the problem into smaller subproblems and leveraging a
                        bottom-up approach, we can find the optimal subset of
                        items to maximize value within a given weight capacity.
                        The provided Python implementation serves as a powerful
                        tool for solving real-world optimization challenges.
